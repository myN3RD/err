      CORS
      
      (get req is failing)
      (browser console -> Netword Tab -> Response Headers -> look for 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin') -> If does NOT exist -> enable CORS on thge server

app.use(cors());    ?? just this line ?


____ 
const cors = require(cors);

app.use(cors({origin: 'https://foo.com'}));         tells the server to include the cors headers on every repsonse
